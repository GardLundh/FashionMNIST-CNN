# School project on Fashion MNIST dataset. 

The batch size of 100 worked well while having three convolutional layers.
I tried different learning rates and number of epochs. And ended up using 5 epochs and a learning rate of 0.0002.
Having more than 5 epochs made the model overfit, and less than 5 epochs was underfitting. 
So i think 5 epochs is the sweet spot for my chosen parameters. 
I ended up setting the learning rate to 0.0002. It didn't differ much from 0.0001, but seemed to make the model more consistent.
I tried making the learning rate higher, and a learning rate of 0.01 or 0.001 made the model overfit and inconsistent.
All in all i think my chosen parameters works well.
